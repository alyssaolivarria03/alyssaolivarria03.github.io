                                    A new generation of influencers has come on the scene. From earliest youth, they have been exposed to the internet, to social networks, and to mobile systems. That context has produced a hypercognitive generation very comfortable with collecting and cross-referencing many sources of information and with integrating virtual and offline experiences.

                                        For Gen Zers, the key point is not to define themselves through only one stereotype but rather for individuals to experiment with different ways of being themselves and to shape their individual identities over time.

                                        <p>
                                            Gen Z consumers are mostly well educated about brands and the realities behind them. When they are not, they know how to access information and develop a point of view quickly.

                                        Because all the peoples of the world are part of one electronically based, intercommunicating network, young people everywhere share a kind of experience that none of the elders ever had.

                                        Gen Zers believe in the importance of dialogue and accept differences of opinion with the institutions in which they participate and with their own families. They can interact with institutions that reject their personal values without abandoning those values.

                                        A look at older members of Generation Z suggests they are on a somewhat different educational trajectory than the generations that came before them. They are less likely to drop out of high school and more likely to be enrolled in college.

                                        If you feel like you’re in a bit of a rut and you definitely don’t want to spend time watching yet another series, perhaps it’s time to find a new hobby? It can be difficult to find new things that you could be passionate about, but don’t worry!

                                        We are all aware of the things that society wants us to do, or the people our families want us to be. If you don't know yourself very well, it's difficult to choose a life path that makes you feel happy and fulfilled.
